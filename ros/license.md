# License

The core of ROS is licensed under the standard three-clause BSD license. This is a very permissive open license that allows for reuse in commercial and closed source products. You can find more about the BSD license from the Opensource.org [BSD 3-Clause][@BSD_3] page and Wikipedia's [BSD Licenses][@BSD_wiki] entry.

While the core parts of ROS are licensed under the BSD license, other licenses are commonly used in the community packages, such as the [Apache 2.0][@Apache_2.0] license, the [GPL][@GPL] license, the [MIT][@MIT] license, and even proprietary licenses. Each package in the ROS ecosystem is required to specify a license, so that it is easy for you to quickly identify if a package will meet your licensing needs.
